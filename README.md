**SimShip**

Simulation of a ship moving on a cinematic-quality ocean.

**PHILOSOPHY**

No commercial or freeware 3D engine.

Simulation written in C++ with Vulkan, GLFW, GLM, Open Asset Import Library (assimp), libigl, ImGui, OpenAL, stb, Eigen, FFTW3, Pugixml, libnova, Clipper2.

Real time simulation with high rate of frames per second (target of 120 fps in fullscreen 2560 x 1440).

The rendering of the 3D scene is optimized to ensure consistency of visual quality between all elements: ocean, ship, sky, clouds, terrain, mist or fog effects.

**OCEAN**

Spectral wind wave model.
Several spectra: Phillips, Bretschneider,	Pierson-Moskowitz, JONSWAP,	OchiHubble, Texel-Marsen-Arsloe, Donelan-Banner, Torsethaugen, Elfouhaily, Horvath.
Dynamic PBR anisotropic BRDF.
Foam simulation on waves.
Underwater view.
Instanced patches defined by LOD settings.
Host readbacks for in-game physics.
Spectral analysis.

**WIND**

Strength (1 to 30 knots) and direction.

**SKY**

Dynamic sky (physical atmosphere) with moving volumetric clouds.
Sun positioned according to date and time (day and night).
Mist and Fog.

**SHIP**

Full motion over 6 degrees of freedom (surge, sway, heave, yaw, pitch, roll).
Ship motion forces (archimede, gravity, viscous resistance, wave resistance, wind drift, wind rotation, thuster, bow thruster, stern thruster, propellers, rudder).
Propellers and radars animated.
Reflection of the ship on the water.
Shadow.
Wake simulation (Kelvin waves, foam and bubbles).
Smoke simulated with particles.
Flag animated.
Navigation lights.
Autopilot with Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller.

**ENVIRONMENT**

Camera full smooth motion (orbital around the ship, fps, fixed views and free views on board the ship, binoculars).
3D sounds (engines, seagulls, horn).
Terrain (islands).
Markup (buoys with lights).
Lighthouses with beamlights.

**Compilation;;
Only c++ files and shaders are provided with some resource files. Compilation needs the installation of several librairies.
